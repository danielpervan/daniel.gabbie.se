						<h2>Thursday, 6 July 2017</h2>
						<h3>Arrival</h3>
					</header>
					<p>The designated arrival day. Depending on when you set foot in Dubrovnik there will hopefully be some kind of smaller lunch-type of food waiting for you in your room. </p>
					<p>You need to handle your own transportation from the airport to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pervanovo+Apartments/@42.660837,18.0679923,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x134c75397a2eab95:0xca8bb81ad7cccbc8!8m2!3d42.660837!4d18.070181?hl=en">Pervanovo Apartments</a>. There should be plenty of taxis hiding around the airport, which can be easily hunted down. We generally suggest using casting rod and 24g spinner lures, but they also respond well to live bait.</p>
					<p>The rest of the day is free play</p>
					<p><b>Dresscode:</b> T-shirt</p>

						<h2>Friday, 7 July 2017</h2>
						<h3>Close Encounter of the Third Kind</h3>
					</header>
					<h3>Morning</h3>
					<p>The first of the two main eventful days. Breakfast is eaten in isolation within the safety of each respective living compartment. If everything has gone as planned, your designated cold storage apparatus should be stocked with edible breakfast components. If that is not the case, we suggest eating the weakest among you first. If there's any issues with the selection of breakfast person, the reception can provide you with swords, tridents and gladiator helmets for your convenience.</p>
					<p><b>Dresscode:</b> Bathrobe/nightwear/underwear and/or combat gear if needed (see breakfast person)</p>
					<h3>Lunchtime probably at about 12 or 13 o'clock</h3>
					<p>Everyone will gather at Kazbek Hotel to participate in the mandatory pool-party-fun-time. Absence will be noted and disciplined.</p>
					<p><b>Dresscode:</b> Bathing suite or similar.</p>
					<h3>Evening, like at around 20:00</h3>
					<p>Dinner will be held at <a href="https://www.google.se/maps/place/Ul.+Ivana+pl.+Zajca+26,+20000,+Dubrovnik,+Croatia/@42.6637136,18.0657774,272m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x134c7546b0712611:0x37678b2b758dea54!8m2!3d42.6637136!4d18.066661?hl=en">Villa Kapetana</a>. Make sure to have showered and dressed up before that.</p>
					<p><b>Dresscode:</b> Proper, but comfortable.</p>

						<h3>The Happening</h3>
					</header>
					<p>It's finally happening. The big day. The grande finale. The reason why you are where you are.</p>
					<h3>Morning</h3>
					<p>Nothing is planned for the morning.</p>
					<h3>Lunch</h3>
					<p>Nothing is planned for lunch.</p>
					<h3>Afternoon, at about 15:00</h3>
					<p>Busses are going to pick you up at your respective living compartment to drive you to <a href="https://www.google.se/maps/place/Villa+Tereza/@42.5573233,18.264627,294m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x134c123ef51b1cc9:0xd59d3549d9ee889!2sVilla+Tereza!8m2!3d42.5573233!4d18.264627!3m4!1s0x134c123ef51b1cc9:0xd59d3549d9ee889!8m2!3d42.5573233!4d18.264627?hl=en">Villa Tereza</a>. There, you will get some drinks, snacks and witness the union of Gabriella and Daniel for roughly all eternity. It's going to be tremendous; believe us.</p>
					<p>It's going to be warm so make sure to drink a lot of water and perhaps something to eat beforehand.</p>
					<p><b>Dresscode:</b> Tailcoat and long dress.</p>
					<h3>Evening, at about 19:30</h3>
					<p>After everything is well and done, and everyone who should be married are married, the busses will arrive again and take us back to <a href="https://www.google.se/maps/place/Hotel+Kazbek/@42.6578719,18.077996,833m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x134c753a7cadf131:0x9878fa0392ff1273!8m2!3d42.6578719!4d18.0801847?hl=en">Hotel Kazbek</a> where we will enjoy a lovely dinner until we can't stand it anymore. The dinner starts at about 20:00 and lasts until late o'clock.</p>
					<p><b>Dresscode:</b> The same tailcoat and dress that you had earlier.</p>
